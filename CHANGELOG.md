## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-02

### 🚀 New Additions
### Added
- **Training Data and Images**  
  Added screwdrivers images from every angle for training. This is still in testing until a robust database is achieved.
  Cannot upload here due to storage.
  
- **Labels**  
  Added labels for each image where each `.txt` file contains every point from the mask, calculated by `create_bbox.py`.


- **Scripts**  
  - `create_bbox.py`: Script to calculate bounding boxes and generate labels for training data.
  - `train.py`: Main training model script using YOLO11x-seg for segmentation.
  - `mask_gen.py`: Generates detail mask around the object for segmentation
  

- **Config**
  - Config file for yolo11-seg
  

- **Model Files**  
  Added `yolo11x-seg.pt` in the `models/` folder for model weights.


- **Training Results**  
  Completed six segmentation training sessions; `train4` has shown the best accuracy so far (see `test_results` folder).


- **Testing**  
  - `test_script.py`: Processes an image from `images/test` with the trained model to verify detection. Not very accurate yet


- **Output**  
  Added `test_results` folder generated by `test_script.py` for storing output from test runs.
